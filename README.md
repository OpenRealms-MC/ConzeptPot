# OpenSourceMinecraft - Concept Pot

Welcome to the `ConceptPot` repository for the OpenSourceMinecraft project!

This repository serves as the central hub for all ideas, concepts, storylines, and features that we are developing for our unique Minecraft server. This is where the creative process begins and where we gather and present the vision for our community-driven adventure.

### **Our Core Vision**

Our server is inspired by games like Genshin Impact and focuses on a rich, story-driven world rather than a simple sandbox experience. The goal is to build a hand-crafted universe with quests, custom mechanics, and a compelling narrative, all shaped by the community.

### **Concepts & Ideas**

Below you will find a list of concepts that are either in development, planned, or ready for discussion. We encourage you to contribute your own ideas or provide feedback on existing ones by opening an issue or a pull request.

#### **Storyline & Lore**

_Coming Soon:_ Here we will present the detailed backstory, the main plot, and the lore of our world.

#### **Unique Features & Mechanics**

_Coming Soon:_ This section will describe custom features, such as new blocks, crafting systems, or interactive world elements.

#### **Classes & Skills**

_In Planning:_ We are working on a system of custom classes and skills that will allow players to specialize their character and experience a new kind of progression.

### **Visualizations & Art**

This section is dedicated to concept art, sketches, and visual representations of our ideas.

### **How to Contribute**

We welcome all ideas! If you have a concept you want to share, simply create a new folder for your idea and add a `README.md` inside it, or open a pull request with your suggestions. Let's build this world together!
